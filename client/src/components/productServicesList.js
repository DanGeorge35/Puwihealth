    description: `In Naturopathic medicine, the accumulation 
    of wastes and toxins in the body is the main 
    cause of diseases. Stress, negative emotions, 
    unhealthy diet, and nutritional deficiencies 
    can make the organs of detoxification 
    sluggish or stop working completely.
    So the far infra-red spectrum energy room 
    helps reduce the toxic load in the body by 
    pulling out wastes and toxins through sweat. 
    By doing this, the body will now have the right 
    environment to start healing itself.
    The energy bucket also works in the same 
    way. But it can only accommodate the legs 
    while the energy room can accommodate the 
    whole body.
    The energy room is different from a sauna. A 
    sauna cannot penetrate deep into the bones 
    but the energy room can. The energy room 
    also has black tourmaline stones which also 
    emits its own frequency to help correct 
    abnormalities in the body.`,

    Hydrogenated water is a highly therapeutic water with lots of amazing health 
    benefits. 
    The more hydrogen molecule a water has, the more medicinal that water is. One 
    liter of our hydrogen water is equivalent to 500 Apples or 400 bananas. 
    Some of the important health benefits of hydrogen water are: 
     Boosts your mood and improves mental health by boosting your 
    levels of serotonin 
     Promotes weight loss by enhancing the metabolism of lipids and 
    carbohydrates. 
     Regulates your sugar levels by decreasing low density lipoproteins 
     Prevents cancer and also helps in cancer treatment. It reduces the 
    adverse side effects of chemotherapy and radiation
     Promotes eye health 
     Relieves arthritis by healing inflammations and swellings in the body
     Promotes oral health by healing inflammation and removing free 
    radicals from the body 
     Hydrogen water protects your skin from UV rays 
     Reduces muscle fatigue, heals muscle cramps and sprains 
     Increases physical energy 
     Protects the brain by removing free radicals from the body 
     Promotes the pH balance of the body
     Promotes wound healing, etc. 
    At Puwi Health Wellness Center, we don't only have hydrogenated water, we also 
    sell the hydrogenated apparatus for individuals or organizations that will need 
    them at their homes or offices. 
    We have the: 
     Hydrogen water flask, hydrogenates at least 500 ml of water in 3 
    minutes. The flask is light weight and you can easily carry it around 
    as you go about your daily activities. 
     Hydrogen water purification system which can be installed in your 
    homes or offices. This is big and can't be carried about. 
    We also have the Bio Pure Ultra which is a stylish and compact device which can 
    be installed in the next to your sink or counter top to instantly filter tap water 
    and dispense the water through a 180 degrees spout. This is a water filtration 
    system only and does not hydrogenate water.`,
